# Summary
Generative AI models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in software development tasks. **However, to use AIcoding agents effectively within an organization, it is essential to provide them with detailed, unambiguous instructions and to follow prompt engineering best practices.**

**When instructions are vague—such as “write unit test cases” or “install Java version 25” —coding agents may interpret them in different ways. As a result, the generated output may fail to align with the standards, conventions, or workflows established by a team or organization.**

For example, even for a simple task like Java installation, an organization may follow specific conventions such as:
1. **Use Amazon-provided Java** — there are dozens of Java providers available.
2. **Install Java in directories where developers have write permissions.**
3. **Import internal CA certificates provided by the security team** — since multiple approaches exist, specify the exact method your organization uses and provide examples to the coding agent.
4. **Use a specific package manager such as SDKMAN to install Java versions** — include sample installation commands to guide the agent.

**Vague instructions may provide some limited benefit, but to use coding agents properly, detailed andunambiguous instruction files are required.**
**When an organization is in the early stages of adopting AI coding agents, creating instruction files with bestpractices for various tasks will be highly beneficial.**

Examples of tasks that benefit from AI coding agent instruction files include (though many others exist):
1. Best practices and conventions for generating unit test cases.
2. Guidelines for writing integration tests.
3. Language-specific coding best practices for each programming language.

Instruction files tend to become lengthy when following prompt engineering best practices. This is because including sample code in the instructions helps reduce hallucinations by coding agents. A few experienced engineers can writethese AI coding agent instruction files and add them to each Git repository.
Once experienced engineers create and commit these instruction files to the Git repository, **any subsequently generated code will adhere to the conventions and best practices outlined in those files.**

While creating AI coding agent instruction files is a time-consuming process that typically requires experienced engineers, Generative AI models can significantly streamline this task by assisting in drafting and refining theseinstructions.
The remainder of this document provides details on the instruction file for generating unit test cases.

# AI Coding Agent Limitations and Guidance
AI does not possess true intelligence. Instead, it excels at memorizing vast training datasets and simply follows patterns found in the code provided as context, as well as the code on which it was trained. **If the files added to thecontext contain error-prone practices, the code generated by the coding agent will likely replicate those samemistakes. Therefore, it is crucial to guide the coding agent to follow best practices and established guidelines.**

## The Importance of Writing Test Cases According to Best Practices
**One of the primary purposes of unit test cases is to ensure that, during code refactoring, well-written unit testscan verify whether the refactored code functions correctly without breaking any of the application's original functionality.**
If unit tests are poorly written (for example, if they test the implementation details rather than the business features),refactoring may cause many unit tests to fail. In such cases, developers must determine whether the failures are due to issues introduced by the refactoring or because the unit tests themselves were not written correctly.
For this reason, adhering to best practices in unit testing is essential.

# Unit Test Cases Best Practices
The Claude AI model was used to research unit-testing best practices, generate example code, and produce the coding-agent instruction document.

## Follow the FIRST Principles
**Summary:** Tests should be Fast, Independent/Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating, and Timely to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Best Practices
- **F - Fast:** Execute in milliseconds to encourage frequent runs during development
- **I - Independent/Isolated:** Each test should be completely independent of other tests. Tests shouldn't rely on the execution order or share state. One test's success or failure shouldn't affect another.
  - No shared mutable state between tests
  - Each test sets up its own data
  - Tests can run in any order or in parallel
- **R - Repeatable:** Produce consistent results regardless of environment or execution order - Repeatable
  - Avoid dependencies on:
    - Current date/time (use mocking or fixed values)
    - External systems (databases, APIs - use mocks or in-memory alternatives)
    - Network conditions
    - Random values (use seeded random or fixed values)
- **S - Self-Valididating:** Automatically verify pass/fail without manual inspection
- **T - Timely:** Tests should be written at the right time - ideally just before or alongside the production codeCode Example
